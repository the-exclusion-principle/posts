- frustration. re-reading the practice questions in hope for a new perspective. notebooks full of chaotic notes. late nights, dimmed lights. a mild headache that comes and goes. worksheets lying around. looking at the stars in the sky after a late class, thinking that someday, you’ll be far away from here, doing something you love, then thinking that maybe, just maybe, it wasn’t all bad. thinking often of all the things you could be doing if you didn't have to study, but really, you wouldn’t know what to do yourself. quiet moments of absolute despair in between classes or after a test or at your desk after a long day, because "oh god there’s hundreds of thousands of people writing this exam and i can’t compete with any of them". getting up early to work in peace. cold, sleepless nights and too many thoughts, matched with too little words to express them. yearning for comfort in a busy, blocked-in schedule. discomfort and disappointment in how quickly things change, but pushing through nonetheless. quiet, dark, late hours of the night with lo-fi music and steaming hot coffee. black framed glasses and a glint of understanding.
