How to pull an all-nighter effectively and still do\
well on your exam

Cramming weeks of biology or accounting material into the 12 hours prior to the exam is a prevalent\
trend on college campuses. It is amazing to me how many students are able to stay up all night and then\
take an exam. Our sleep and wakefulness cydes are governed by the arcadian rotation of the earth, and\
overriding these cycles is extremely difficu, and 20 So I guess you deserve kudos for that in a semi-\
backwards way!

According to Dr. Charmane Eastman, director of Biological Rhythms Research Laboratory at a medical\
center in Chicago, what makes interrupting these cycles so difficult is that they exist even in the absence\
of time cues such as sunlight and docks.

Part of the issue ts that most students enter the 12-hour "al-nighter" penod without having slept the\
Previous 12 hours, so them brain is already working less efficiently.

Unfortunately, there ts no way to beat the clock completely as staying up all night takes a toll on both\
your physxal and mental performance. However, Penn State undergraduate studies say that\
understanding exactiy what is happening to your body's natural rhythms throughout the night can help\
all the raght owls out there maumize brain power.

10 - 11 p.m.: This varies for most people but around 11 p.m., the first yawns start to occur as your usual\
bedome ts approactang. Talung an earty evening nap will slow your body's dechne around this bme.

11 p.m, + 12 a.m.; Your body temperature will begin to fall as it mamecs the arcadian rhythm cyde. if the\
room you are studying in was comfortable, ¢ may now feel cold. Instead of turning up the heat (which\
can put some people to sleep), throw on a sweater or jacket. At this point, caffesne is not your fnend., It\
will make you feel antsy and anxious. ft will also be less and less effective the later (or earher) & gets.\
Reach for a kght, healthy snack € you feel the urge to chug a Starbucks beverage.

1 a.m, - 2 a.m: The best strategy is to study the toughest material fest because it requires the most\
brain power. Save the easier work for the early moming hours as you wil probably be exhausted and\
much less motvated. Exercise can also help with drowsiness s0 drop and give me twenty! Just teasing\
but gosng for a short walk can defintely help you feel inngorated. Relocating can also be helpful.

This is also about the time you start feeling hungry so snacking is the best way to defeat drowsiness.\
Obviously, you want to avoid eating a four-course meal. Grabbing a yoourt, cottage cheese, fruits or\
vegetables is gong to be your best bet. Iced tea, cub soda and juice wall be more beneficial than\
2 <0 soda. Chocolate mi is another hidden treasure as & provides both caffeine and sugar. Cant\
eat 1

4a.m. - $ a.m.: You're probably feeling pretty darn good at this point as the second wind is kicking in.\
'Shortly following Uhés is the desire to take a "quick" nap because your biological clock is ticking quite\
slowty. if you have between one and two hours to spare, | would recommend taking a nap because\
waking up wil be easier than if you just doze off for 15 minutes.

6 a.m. - 7 a.m.: Go outside and view every all-nighter's ultimate reward: the sursise. Grab a ight\
breakfast consisting of some carbohydrates and protein (or one of the two) but try and avoid as much fat\
a8 you can. Fat takes awhile to digest, which can make you feel shuggish.

8 a.m.: TEST TIME APPROACHING. A great pre-exam plan is to exercise, shower and eat 3 high-protein,\
low-fat breakfast (I would take advantage of the pt omelet station for some egg whites with veggies).\
After the cest is over, the carbohydrate-depnved can now binge on pasta, bread and cereal in\
preparation for sleep. To get your body back on track, takang 2 one to two hour nap wal be more effechve\
than sleeping all day. And congratulsbons! You have successfully defeated your arcadian rhythm!
