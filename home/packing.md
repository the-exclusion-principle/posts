> ***get the right luggage for the trip***

*If you're flying:*

-   Regulations allow you to have two carry on bags - one personal item (purse or laptop bag, or item similar in size) and another bag. They can be *no larger than 9 inches x 14 inches x 22 inches,* though at least one should be much smaller.
-   Rolling bags - small as a carry-on, or larger if you're checking a bag.
-   Backpacks - day packs for little things, or backpacking size for your main bag.
-   Tote bags - DON'T overpack these! Just keep the essentials in here so you don't break your back.
-   A [small cross-body bag](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zappos.com%2Fbaggallini-zipper-bag-charcoal%3Fef_id%3DVmXAlwAAAaNLmfX2%3A20160524051916%3As&t=NDhmZDFmZDMwYmYzMDU0Mzg2MGJiODhlODYzZjZkNDA5ZjIyNWE4YixhMmRmYjI5MmRlOWM2YjYyMjM2OTVhNTYxODUwZDQ4NmI4MGU2YzY5&ts=1675922130) to keep your passport in. Keep it on you *at all times,* ~~lest you forget your backpack on a bus in Paris with no one around that speaks English to help you, not that that happened to me.~~
-   Remember that if you're checking a bag it needs to be under 50 pounds or you'll be charged extra.

*If you're driving:*

-   Rolling bags
-   Duffel bags 
-   Basically anything! You have a lot of flexibility here, just be mindful that you'll be sharing the space with other people's bags, *and* having to ride in it -- nobody likes sitting in an overpacked backseat.

> ***what to take in your carry-on***

-   Important travel documents (passport, boarding pass, copy of hotel reservations, etc)
-   Your phone & charger
-   Some cash
-   Earbuds (and music on your phone)
-   A book, ebook, or magazine (don't go crazy and bring your whole bookshelf - one is enough)
-   A journal and pen, for making note of important things or filling out customs forms.
-   A light hoodie -- planes are cold!
-   Some snacks (that don't smell -- be kind to your fellow flyers)
-   An **empty** water bottle -- fill it up when you're past security.
-   Any medications you have, in their original bottle if they're prescription.
-   A change of clothes, in case your luggage is lost.
-   Glasses/sunglasses
-   A [foldable tote bag](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fbaggu.com%2Fcollections%2Fnylon&t=YjdkYTgyMjU5YzY3NTRmYTBlMjczZmYzNGZlMDM1MzRiZjQwMGU2Niw4YmIyZmM2NjE1MzIyMzBmNWI0MzIwNzljNDgwMDE2ODA0YmM0OTJj&ts=1675922130), so that when you get to your gate you can take the essentials (phone, charger, book, snacks) out of your main bag to store under your seat, and stow the rest in the overhead bins.
-   If you're traveling with film, be sure to keep it in your carry on and take it out for TSA to hand check -- the x-rays will ruin it otherwise.
-   Anything that you couldn't live without if your luggage
-   Don't forget that liquids need to be under 3.4oz and in one 1 quart clear bag and taken out at security, so don't bury them at the bottom of the bag.
-   Laptops also need to be in their own tray, so keep it handy! (tablets are fine to stay in your bag though!)

> ***how to avoid overpacking***

-   Edit edit edit
-   Pack everything you think you need, then take it all out and cull anything that you're not positive you will need. Repeat until you're left with only the basics.
-   If you don't wear it at home, you won't wear it there. Only pack stuff you love.
-   Bring stuff that works for multiple outfits -- if you can only wear it once, it stays at home.
-   Exception: You're going somewhere for a specific event, like a wedding. In that case, *please* don't leave a bridesmaid dress at home *or* wear it multiple times that trip, cause like, that's weird.
-   Side note: this should go without saying, but this does not apply to underwear.
-   Check the weather, and avoid the whole "But what if it rains and I need an umbrella!" bit.
-   Have a general idea of what you'll be doing and what you'll need to wear, for the same reason as above.
-   *Make a list before you even open your closet* -- that way you'll know how many shirts you need up front, instead of doing the whole "oooohhh this is cute, I'll pack it. and this, and this, and this" thing where you eventually spiral into insanity, and bring roughly 30 shirts with you.

-   Ziplock bags in every size. Bring extras, you'll need them.
-   [Packing cubes](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fshop.eaglecreek.com%2Fpacking-cubes%2Fl%2F212&t=Zjc0MzFmYTA5M2NhN2YyMGIwMjczYmUwYjgwZWE5MGVjM2Y2MWNmZSxmMzMyOThkMTdkNDZkN2UwNGE0NjRhNzkxMmFlNjk2YWMxMTkwZDJl&ts=1675922130), to keep your black hole of a backpack from eating your socks.
-   [Hanging toiletries organizer](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.verabradley.com%2Fproduct%2Fhanging-organizer%2Fcobalt-tile%2F1004362_205043.uts&t=MDdhMjMwOWI0ZjM0ZDQ5YjMwMzdjMDMyMGUyNTk0NDRlOWNkNmRlZSxmMGRiNGI5M2ZlMTVmNmRhNzk4ZWE5ZGQwYWRmZTFkYjQwZWIyOTI3&ts=1675922130). Seriously my favorite purchase ever. It has saved me so much time and hassle, I'll never travel without it.
-   I'm a huge believer in using makeup bags to organize *everything*. Chargers, snacks, hair ties, you name it. 

*Clothes/toiletries/misc*

-   A light hoodie or raincoat
-   COMFORTABLE shoes
-   A slightly dressy outfit in case you wanna go out for a nice dinner
-   More underwear than you think you need
-   Toothbrush/toothpaste/floss/a dentist
-   Shampoo (I love bars for flying!)
-   Anything you use in your nightly/daily routine
-   Ask for samples at Sephora/department stores to get TSA friendly sizes of makeup/lotion/whatever

> ***other important notes***

-   Never keep your passport or wallet in a backpack -- make sure it's somewhere that you can keep an eye on, especially in crowded areas.
-   Your bag will get five pounds heavier on the way to the airport. I don't know how, but trust me, it will happen. Make sure you've got some wiggle room on that 50lb limit.
-   Always pack less than you think you need. Not having to deal with the stress of heavy bags is worth leaving behind a shirt or two -- you don't need options like you think you do!
-   Leave room for souvenirs! You'll come back with more than you take, even if you don't think you'll be shopping.
-   [RANGER ROLL](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dso93nqxZLjM&t=YjUwMjBiNTJlNmQ3YjQ4NTQzYjUwMjRhYjJlZDM2Nzc4NzI5NjgyNSxtRDBSUlJabg%3D%3D)! It saves sooo much space. 
-   Have fun, and don't stress! If you forget it, you can pick up always pick up another when you get there.
